Why are there 2 folders here? 

Python-Calculator represents the work I did as a team with Francisco, Karl, and Venkata. This implementation of the state machine was done in Python as a learning experience with a new language. 

Python-Calculator can be run from the main directory with `python3 main.py`

Java-Calculator represents the same work I did as a team with Francisco, Karl, and Venkata - I just re-implemented the code in Java so I could personally better understand the Design Patterns at work. 

Java-Calculator can be run from IntelliJ directly (using the Build and Run buttons), or with your java IDE of choice
